# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast who loves:

💻 Coding (sometimes it loves me back, sometimes it doesn't)

🤖 AI (waiting for the day it writes my code for me)

🏥 Healthcare Tech (because saving lives with tech is pretty cool!)

## 🛠️ What I Do

I spend my time:

Debugging things I swear were working 5 minutes ago ⏳

Experimenting with AI (No, I haven’t built Skynet... yet.)

Exploring how technology can make healthcare smarter 💡

## 🎉 Fun Facts

I talk to my code. It doesn’t always listen.

Stack Overflow is my second home.

My AI assistant may or may not be judging my coding skills.

Let's connect and make some cool stuff! 🚀
